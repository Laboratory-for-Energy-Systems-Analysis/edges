        <includedActivitiesEnd xml:lang="en">This activity ends with the production of liquefied nitrogen, oxygen and argon by cryogenic air separation. The dataset includes as input the electricity for processing, the cooling water, and the infrastructure for the air separation plant. This dataset does not include the extraction of noble gases from the liquid gases (e.g. Xenon and Krypton from the liquid oxygen). Air, which is the main resource for air liquefaction, is not considered because of its inexhaustibility and the short recycling time of the withdrawn products (especially for argon and nitrogen, less for oxygen). Emissions to the air are already included in the preceding processes, especialy in the electricity production, and are therefore not considered here. The separated CO2 and water vapour from the separation process were not accounted as emissions. The reason is that these components were already contained in the air input, so that they do not represent effective emissions. As wastewater, there is the unevaporated share of the make-up cooling water, but it is not listed because only minor emissions from this source are expected.</includedActivitiesEnd>
        <generalComment>
          <text xml:lang="en" index="0">This dataset represents the production of liquefied nitrogen, oxygen and argon by cryogenic air separation. The liquefaction process of air represents an average cryogenic air separation process. Cryogenic air separation is currently the most efficient and cost-effective technology for producing large quantities of oxygen, nitrogen, and argon as gaseous or liquid products (Smith &amp; Klosek 2001). The fraction of each output is based on the composition of air (1.4% Argon, 23.1% Oxygen and 75.5% Nitrogen).</text>
          <text xml:lang="en" index="1">Nitrogen (N2) constitutes 78.09% by volume of the air. It is colourless, odourless, and tasteless. Nitrogen is often used as an 'inert' gas due to its non-reactive nature with many materials. Commercial nitrogen is produced by different air separation processes, such as cryogenic liquefaction and distillation, pressure swing adsorption (PSA) and membrane separation. Liquid nitrogen, produced by the cryogenic air separation process, finds wide use as a refrigerant in applications such as cryogenic grinding of plastics and food freezing. Gaseous nitrogen is used in the chemical and petroleum industries for storage tank blanketing and vessel inerting applications, in the food industries to pack oxidisable foods and by the electronics and metals industries for the inert properties.</text>
          <text xml:lang="en" index="2">Oxygen (O2) constitutes 20.95% by volume of the air. Liquid oxygen is pale blue. The principal use of oxygen stems from its strong oxidising properties. Oxygen is produced by air separation processes that use either cryogenic liquefaction and distillation or separation with vacuum swing adsorption (VSA). The major commercial uses of oxygen are in metal manufacturing, metal fabricating, and in health services. Oxygen is also used extensively in the chemical industry and in the pulp and paper industry.</text>
          <text xml:lang="en" index="3">Argon (Ar) is a monatomic, chemically inert gas composing slightly less than 0.93% by volume of the air. Argon is colourless, odourless, tasteless, non-corrosive, non-flammable, and non-toxic. Argon is the most abundant and most used of the noble gases. Commercial argon is the product of cryogenic air separation. Argon is the most abundant and most used of the noble gases. Its chief use is in metallurgy, where it provides an inert atmosphere in which hot metals can be worked. Because argon is very un-reactive, it prevents chemical reactions of the very hot metal being welded or forged.</text>

          <text xml:lang="en" index="0">The main components of air are nitrogen and oxygen, but it also contains smaller amounts of water vapour, argon, carbon dioxide and very small amounts of other gases (e.g. noble gases). The purification and liquefaction of various components of air, in particular oxygen, nitrogen and argon, is an important industrial process, and it is called cryogenic air separation. </text>
          <text xml:lang="en" index="1">Cryogenic distillation accounts for approximately 85% of nitrogen and over 95% of oxygen production. It is the preferred supply mode for high volume and high purity requirements (Praxair 2002). Cryogenic air separation is currently the most efficient and cost-effective technology for producing large quantities of oxygen, nitrogen, and argon as gaseous or liquid products (Smith &amp; Klosek 2001). Besides the air needed as a resource the major input for the liquefying process is the electricity to compress the inlet air, which normally comprises 95% of the utility costs of a cryogenic air separation plant.  In some plants the amount of processed air (in Nm3) can be up to 5 times larger than the derived liquid products (Cryogenmash 2001). In these plants, the waste gas stream is naturally also much larger (in order to obtain the mass balance). As output of the cryogenic air separation there are three products: liquid oxygen, liquid nitrogen and liquid crude argon. The assumed process includes no gaseous co-products. In reality gaseous products are also processed if there is a demand at the production site. The investigated cryogenic air separation process leads to liquid products in the following quality:</text>
          <text xml:lang="en" index="2">-	Liquid oxygen: min. 99.6 wt-%</text>
          <text xml:lang="en" index="3">-	Liquid nitrogen: min. 99.9995 wt-%</text>
          <text xml:lang="en" index="4">-	Liquid argon, crude: 96-98 wt-%</text>
          <text xml:lang="en" index="5">An air pre-treatment section downstream of the air compression (0.7 MPa) and after cooling removes process contaminants, including water, carbon dioxide, and hydrocarbons. The air is then cooled to cryogenic temperatures and distilled into oxygen, nitrogen, and, optionally, argon streams. Alternate compressing and expanding the recycled air can liquefy most of it.</text>
          <text xml:lang="en" index="6">Numerous configurations of heat exchange and distillation equipment can separate air into the required product streams. These process alternatives are selected based on the purity and number of product streams, required trade-offs between capital costs and power consumption, and the degree of integration between the air separate unit and other facility units. This process requires very complicated heat integration techniques because the only heat sink for cooling or condensation is another cryogenic stream in the process.</text>
          <text xml:lang="en" index="7">Since the boiling point of argon is between that of oxygen and nitrogen, it acts as an impurity in the product streams. If argon were collected and separated from the oxygen product, an oxygen purity of less than 95% by volume would result (Barron &amp; Randall 1985). On the other hand, if argon were collected with the nitrogen product, the purity of nitrogen would not exceed 98.7% by volume. To achieve higher purities of oxygen and nitrogen the elimination of argon is necessary.</text>
          <text xml:lang="en" index="8">Commercial argon is the product of cryogenic air separation, where liquefaction and distillation processes are used to produce a low-purity crude argon product. </text>

In the case when no industry/literature data are available about the type of cooling or directly fraction, cooling water, to air specific for the process a default assumption is applied. It is assumed that the once-through cooling system is used in 50% of all cases and recirculating system is used in another 50% of all cases. </comment>
