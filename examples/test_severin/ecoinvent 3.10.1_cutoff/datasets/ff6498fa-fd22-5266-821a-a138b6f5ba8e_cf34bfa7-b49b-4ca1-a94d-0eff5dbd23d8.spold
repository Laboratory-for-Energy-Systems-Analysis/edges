          <text xml:lang="en" index="0">This dataset represents the transport of one metric ton.km of freight in South Africa by a 3.5-7.5 metric ton lorry not meeting any emission standard. The dataset represents the entire transport life cycle, including the production and maintenance of the vehicle, the transportation of goods and the construction, operation, maintenance and disposal of the road pavement. The scope of the dataset is the operation of the vehicle, which has inputs of vehicle production, vehicle maintenance, and road pavement construction, maintenance and operation, via linking to global datasets (i.e. the equipment and infrastructure datasets are not South African-specific). The dataset represents the average 3.5-7.5 metric ton lorry not meeting any emission standard vehicle within South Africa and is therefore an average across both petrol and diesel vehicles (i.e. the dataset represents the average of the entire fleet and shows the fuel use, both in terms of petrol and diesel, for the movement of a tonne.km of freight).   </text>
          <text xml:lang="en" index="1">The average freight load of a 3.5-7.5 metric ton lorry is 3.9 tonnes, with an average freight load factor of 50% (both values calculated from SATIM model (ERC, 2015), which used factors from the Road Freight Association's vehicle cost schedule and calibrated these values to the 2014 tonne.kms reported by the Department of Logistics at the University of Stellenbosch. The load factor accounts for all transport trips). The average gross vehicle mass (GVW) is 7.1 tonnes (calculated from freight loading and that freight accounts for 55% of GVW in a heavy commercial vehicle (DoT,2009).</text>
          <text xml:lang="en" index="2"> The dataset is not parameterised and factors cannot be changed by users.</text>
          <text xml:lang="en" index="3">Fuel consumption and the primary emissions (nitrogen oxides, nitrous oxide, methane, non-methane hydrocarbons, ammonia, benzene and lead) are modelled based on information and assumptions on fleet mixes and usage of vehicles in different road and traffic situations. Basic emission data is taken from HBEFA 3.4. (INFRAS, 2017), with extensive weighted averaging of vehicles in different traffic situations performed (see report for parameters applied and data sources for road and traffic conditions in South Africa). Emission factors for sulphur dioxide and for carbon dioxide are not taken directly from HBEFA but are calculated using the carbon content and the sulphur content of diesel and petrol in South Africa (and the fuel consumption). Heavy metal emissions to air (other than lead) are extrapolated from "transport, freight, lorry 3.5-7.5 metric ton, EURO3" on the basis of diesel consumption and "transport, passenger car, large size, petrol, EURO3, GLO, 2012" on the basis of petrol consumption. Emissions arising from wear of tyres, brakes and road are calculated from the applicable global datasets ("treatment of tyre/brake/road wear emissions, lorry, GLO, 2013") on the basis of GVW and freight loading.     </text>
          <text xml:lang="en" index="4">Vehicle production and maintenance is described in the individual global datasets. Vehicle demand per tonne.km is calculated based on the lifetime kilometric performance, taken from Spielmann et al., (2007) (540,000 km for a heavy commercial vehicle), and the average freight load. The average freight load is calculated from the SATIM model (ERC, 2015), weighted to account for the current commercial vehicle fleet in South Africa (eNaTIS, 2017). Road construction, maintenance and disposal, and road operation are described in the individual global datasets. Road demand per tonne.km is calculated based on weighted road usage of each vehicle type of the road network in South Africa (see report for calculations and data sources). </text>

Basic emission data is taken from HBEFA 3.4.

Sulphur dioxide and carbon dioxide emissions reflect the sulphur and carbon content of fuels in South Africa.

This value is therefore a rough estimation. It may underestimate the real price since there are additional expenses when producing any product. These expences can include for example labour costs, treatment of waste materials and profit for the producer.

        <productionVolumeComment xml:lang="en">South African tonne.kms calculated from current South African commercial vehicle fleet and road freight data. The commercial vehicle fleet is based on total vehicle fleet data for 2017 (eNaTIS, 2017) and SATIM model data (ERC, 2015), which includes data on the breakdown of the vehicle fleet into size classes, average freight payloads, annual mileage, annual mileage decay, historic sales and scrapping factors. Freight payloads account for 51% and 55% of gross vehicle weights (GVW) for light commercial vehicles (LVC) and heavy commercial vehicles respectively in South Africa (DoT, 2009), which is used to correlate the average freight payloads with the GVW categories in ecoinvent. Commercial vehicles are split into relevant emission classes based on Thambiran &amp; Diab (2011) and the fact that all vehicles sold since 2006 have been of a Euro2 standard (Nare &amp; Kamakate, 2017; SAPIA, 2015).
