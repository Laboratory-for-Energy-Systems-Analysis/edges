          <text xml:lang="en" index="0">The process represents the treatment of a waste (sewage sludge) that is exclusively produced from another waste treatment. Municipal incineration is the controlled combustion of a waste. Sewage sludge with 70% water is generated during wastewater treatement (WWT) of leachate from the sanitary landfilling (SLF) of 'waste paint'. Recommended use of this dataset: to be used within the specific chain of treatments for 'waste paint'. Share of biogenic carbon in the sludge: 0%.</text>

- The total water in wet mass of all input exchanges (0.77557157308874) and output exchanges (0.955240371846231) is unbalanced.

- Uncertainty shall always be provided for all primary data inputs (exchange amounts, properties and parameters), except for the amount and properties of reference products.
